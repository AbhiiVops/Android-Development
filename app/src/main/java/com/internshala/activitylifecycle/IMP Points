Basics Of XML

code in XML is written using tags.

<Tag></Tag> = <Tag/>
<LinearLayout></LinearLayout> = <LinearLayout/>  //-> After equal to is the short syntax for writing tag
we have parent and child tag in xml

The short syntax for writing a tag is only used when that tag does not have any child tags.If the
tags have children then they will be present between the two parent tags(opening and closing)

// Syntax for writing tags:

<LinearLayout

android:width="match_parent"
android:height="match_parent"
</LinearLayout>

What is layout?
A layout defines the structure in which the various elements on the screen or the activity will be arranged
all the elements in a layout are built using a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects

View : A view object is something that is drawn and that the user interacts with. It is a concrete element on the screen that is visible to the user
ViewGroup : ViewGroup objects are invisible objects that contain other View and ViewGroup objects

Views are called as widgets
ViewGroup are called layouts


What are pixels?
Pixel density is the number of pixels present per unit of the screen
It is measured in ppi(pixels per inch)
the more the ppi the better is the quality of the screen

DP : Density independent pixel --> used for defining the size of an image or margin
SP : Scalable pixel --> used for defining the size of the text


Whats is the difference between margin and padding?

Margin is used to shift any view from the boundary or the wall of the parent layout
Padding creates space between the View inside the container and the container boundary


Checks for adding images to the layout
1. The image should be of a small size that is between 200 to 300 kb.
2. the image should be in png format
3. the name of the image should be in a format like this : tony_stark.png
4. the name cannot have any capital letters,numbers or special characters except the underscore
5. whenever you name a resource you should name them in a way that can help us identify later the resource is.
