Points to remember

Whenever the screen needs a Scroll View ,all the others views must come inside the scroll view.

A scroll view can only have one child but can have lots of grandchildren.

The name of the app is in the toolbar
and the notification panel is known as the status bar

We can change the colour of toolbar by going to the res->values->colors.xml

colorPrimary : this is the primary or the fundamental color of the app which perform general actions and toolbar have this color
colorPrimaryDark : it is the color of the status bar
colorAccent : this color is used when we want to seek users attention

We can change the title of the app in the toolbar : with the help of the kotlin file i.e, AvengersActivity.kt file
AvengersActivity.kt file -> inside OnCreate method -> Write title then put = and write the name in "".


To change the name of the app -:
Manifests file -> AndroidManifest.xml -> android:label
To change android:label
res file -> values -> strings.xml ->  <string name="new_app_name">The Avengers</string>  <- create a new string
                                      like this and then change the reference in
                                      manifests android:label

or else we can directly change the name of the app



** create activity name by following the conventions of the Class naming

--> To change the launcher activity :

*** we need to mention every new activity we create in the manifests file
  Now android studio does this automatically for us what we need to is cut the intent
  filter tag from current activity and paste it in the new activity
