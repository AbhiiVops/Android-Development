To create a splash screen :

1. Create an empty activity with name Splash Activity
2. In the xml file of this activity add the views
3. Then in the SplashActivity.kt file

// This is used to hide the status bar and make
// the splash screen as a full screen activity.

       window.setFlags(
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN,
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN
        )

        // we used the postDelayed(Runnable, time) method
       // to send a message with a delayed time.

        Handler().postDelayed({
            val intent = Intent(this@SplashActivity, LoginActivity::class.java)
            startActivity(intent)
            finish()
        }, 3000) // 3000 is the delayed time in milliseconds.
