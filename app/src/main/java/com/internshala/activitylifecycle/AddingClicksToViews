What is the findViewById() function ?

The findViewById() function find the views by looking at their ID's
and connects them to the variables we have declared.The function is
defined in the libraries of Android SDK

Adding event listener :
Event listeners simply enable us or our code to listen to an event.An event is anything
that the user does on the app,such as clicking a button or a link.

Where did the Views that we have been using till now come from?
The views that we have been dealing with till now are declared and defined inside the class 'View'
Also this view has an interface called OnClickListener().This interface has a method called
onClick()


Steps for implementing a click on a View :

1. First we declared variables for the various Views by using the 'lateinit' keyword
2. Then we initialised these variables inside the onCreate() method,by using the findViewById() method
3. We used the set onClickListener() on the button,to set a click on the button
4. to provide a framework for this click listener,we implemented the OnClickListener() interface
   of the Views class and then implemented its onClick() method
5. Then we passed the 'this' parameter inside the setOnClickListener() method to use the
   onClick() method we implemented earlier.
6. Finally we created a Toast inside the onClick() method and displayed it on the screen
